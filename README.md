# Steering Law Study (Forge Mod, Minecraft 1.16.1)


## About the project

This mod was developed within the bachelors thesis 
"Evaluating Minecraftâ€™s 
Potential for HCI Research Exemplified by a Steering Law Study"
at the Vienna University of Technology.

## Purpose of this Mod

Using this mod, the player conducts an experiment concerning 
steering law, gathering data in the process. 
this data then will be evaluated, to verify if steering law also applies in 
three-dimensional environments as it does in 2D space.
The experiments itself contain of tunnels the player has to maneuver with their cursor;
in other words, the player has to look at the entire tunnel, 
starting from the green block all the way to the red, as fast as they possibly can
without leaving the tunnel's perimeter.

## How to use

Run mod by using "run-client" via the gradle wrapper.
